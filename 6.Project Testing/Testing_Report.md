# Phase 6: Comprehensive Quality Assurance, Test Suite Matrix, and System Validation Log

## 1. System Testing Strategy & Methodology
The testing framework for the EduGenie AI Assistant project was executed to validate data flow continuity between the asynchronous web interface and the hybrid compute backend core. The execution targeted testing metrics across three foundational boundaries:
1. **Cloud API Boundary Verification:** Ensuring strict JSON shape validation and operational timeout compliance for remote `gemini-1.5-flash` requests.
2. **Local Inference Execution Profiling:** Monitoring host hardware memory allocation stability and internal execution pipelines during processing loops of the `LaMini-Flan-T5-783M` engine.
3. **Frontend Presentation Hardening:** Auditing input-output parameter containers against formatting anomalies and cross-site script validation failures.

## 2. Comprehensive Functional Test Suite Matrix

Every core operational route and system edge behavior was evaluated under continuous test case profiles. The verified test matrix logs are documented below:

| Test ID | Functional Area | Input Trigger Vector | Expected System Behavior | Actual Execution Result | Pass / Fail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-QA-001** | Instant Q&A Route (`/qa`) | Valid textual query: `"Where is India located?"` | Backend executes cloud endpoint call, returning clean, raw factual text summary string. | Cloud framework successfully resolved parameters; output returned in 1240ms. | **PASS** |
| **TC-EX-002** | Local AI Core (`/explain`) | Input block sequence: `"Photosynthesis process detail"` | App loads local pipeline, routes data stream directly onto CPU, and maps step-by-step notes without cloud token calls. | Local inference pipeline executed successfully; weights cached locally inside CPU hardware loops. | **PASS** |
| **TC-QZ-003** | Structural Quiz Matrix (`/quiz`) | Plain text reference block: `[Target Reading Chapter]` | Engine queries cloud model under strict JSON criteria, strips layout markers via `clean_json_block` filters, and returns a parsable array of 3 MCQs. | Array components successfully deserialized via `json.loads()` matching strict `{question, options, answer}` keys. | **PASS** |
| **TC-SM-004** | Text Summarization (`/summarize`) | Dense, high-density academic article excerpt. | System filters paragraph noise, isolates key concept tags, and prints structural summary blocks. | Clean text extraction output rendered without parsing delays. | **PASS** |
| **TC-LP-005** | Learning Roadmap (`/learn/recommendations`) | Target learning skill parameter: `"Web Development"` | Generates progressive roadmap streams using custom prompt wrappers. | Roadmap curriculum layout successfully rendered. | **PASS** |
| **TC-SEC-006** | Presentation Hardening | Raw input text containing cross-site scripts: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` | Client-side security logic isolates specific input boundaries and enforces character conversion to prevent script payload execution. | The `escapeHTML()` function successfully encoded special character tokens to `&lt;script&gt;` entities, neutralizing the payload. | **PASS** |

## 3. Exception Handling & Bug Tracking Log

During continuous integration sprints, specific runtime defects were flagged, analyzed, and systematically corrected. The bug database logs detail the engineering pivots applied:

### Defect ID: BUG-001 – Remote Model Connection Exception (404 Error Matrix)
*   **Environment Signature:** Remote communication protocol layer.
*   **Defect Analysis:** Direct execution hooks hitting the target `gemini-1.5-pro` string identifier failed, triggering severe API error exceptions due to breaking v1beta platform gateway updates.
*   **Resolution Protocol:** Refactored runtime configurations across all core components, establishing global client variable pointers to utilize the production-grade, optimized `gemini-1.5-flash` engine instance.

### Defect ID: BUG-002 – System Layout Path Translation Failure
*   **Environment Signature:** Backend FastAPI asset router assembly (`main.py`).
*   **Defect Analysis:** The application engine crashed immediately upon processing inbound web index requests with a `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: 'index.html'` error log. The local structure mapped templates under a singular folder string block (`template/`), violating runtime framework requirements.
*   **Resolution Protocol:** Updated folder tree configuration settings, renaming the storage folder to `templates/` and correctly allocating the CSS properties inside an isolated static directory tree layer.

### Defect ID: BUG-003 – Raw Markdown Text Rendering Distortion
*   **Environment Signature:** Client-side document parser framework.
*   **Defect Analysis:** Dynamic AI roadmap output blocks returned string notation elements (e.g., `##` and `**`) as literal characters on the user interface viewport, failing to render native HTML structures.
*   **Resolution Protocol:** Developed an autonomous JavaScript text conversion pipeline (`renderMarkdownLite`) to evaluate output strings line-by-line using structured regular expression filters, instantly transforming raw headers and bold markers into safe, semantic HTML5 document nodes.
